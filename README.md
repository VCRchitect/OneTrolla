This is an ongoing project that aims to create a cheap, easy-to-use controller for those that have the usage of only one hand. 

The controller uses a custom circuit board that is paired with an Arduino Pro Micro and an MPU6050 Accelerometer. It has full compatibility as a wired controller for the Nintendo Switch, PC (including STEAM), Steam Deck, and Android phones (with an OTG cable or adapter).

HOW DO I USE IT?

The single analog stick on the device will act as either the left analog stick or right analog stick of a controller, depending on which mode you're in. The other stick will be controlled via motion and the accelerometer.

You can tilt the controller as if it were an arcade stick and it will act accordingly. I have inverted up and down on the left stick because, through my playtesting, it feels more natural to run forward by lifting up the controller. Not many games require running backwards, so pressing down is tilting forward, which feels less natural and, therefore, less used.

To quickly and easily swap which stick is which, press the button on the very bottom right of the controller (while you're looking directly at the buttons).

The buttons are arranged in a + pattern, just like most modern controllers. Top is X, left is Y, right is A, down is B, just like the Nintendo Switch. The two buttons below are the left trigger and right trigger.

In order to access the secondary buttons, hold down a primary button. X is Start, Y is R3, A is L3, B is Select, left trigger is LB, and right trigger is RB. If you are playing a game that requires holding a button that is considered a "primary" button, press it repeatedly and it will register as being consistently held.

To use the DPAD, press the physical analog stick in and tilt the analog stick in a direction to press the corresponding DPAD button.

The bottom left button (when you're looking directly at the buttons) is the HOME button. Tap it repeatedly to bring up the sleep menu. If you hold the HOME button until the LED changes, it will turn off the toggle function, making all the buttons function exactly the same as each other.

The toggles are for left trigger, right trigger, L3, and R3, which are buttons that are often held. Games like Zelda make this a necessity. Games like Mario 64 don't need the toggles, so they're easy to turn off.

Speaking of turning things off, it's easy to turn off the accelerometer and just use the stick for more basic games. You simply flip the physical toggle switch to the left of the B button.

If this isn't making as much sense as I'd like, review this image (some slight differences may be here because of more recent board revisions):

If that still doesn't make any sense, please check out this vide (with timestamps!) that I made to explain everything and show off some gameplay:
